# Project Brief: BrickLink Storage Location Auto-Populator

## Core Feature Specification

**Application Purpose**: Automate storage location assignment for new LEGO parts by leveraging existing inventory data from BrickLink store.

### Technical Requirements

#### 1. File Processing
- Import/parse BSX (BrickStore XML) files
- Export modified BSX files with user-specified naming (overwrite original or create new file)

#### 2. BrickLink API Integration
- Retrieve complete store inventory via BrickLink API
- Extract item details: ItemID, ColorID, Condition, and Remarks field
- Handle API authentication and rate limiting

#### 3. Location Matching Algorithm
- For each new part, query existing inventory for matching ItemID
- Ignore color and condition differences when matching
- When multiple locations exist for same ItemID, select most frequently used location
- Leave remarks empty if no existing location found

#### 4. Data Structure Understanding
- Parse BSX XML structure (items, colors, conditions, remarks)
- Maintain all existing BSX data while updating only remarks field
- Handle various item types (Parts, Minifigures, Sets, etc.)

## Architecture Considerations for Future Expansion

The application should be designed with modularity to accommodate these planned features:

- **Location allocation system**: Ability to assign new locations based on available storage slots
- **Location optimization**: Suggest storage reorganization for efficiency
- **Advanced location rules**: Priority systems, category-based storage, size considerations  
- **Analytics integration**: Retrieval of analytics based on current inventory and past sales data

## Technical Architecture Recommendations

- **Modular design**: Separate API handling, file processing, and business logic
- **Configuration system**: Store API credentials, location formats, business rules
- **Caching layer**: Store inventory data locally to reduce API calls
- **Error handling**: Robust handling of API failures, malformed files, network issues
- **Logging**: Track operations for debugging and audit purposes

## User Interface Requirements

- Simple file selection (drag-drop or file picker)
- Progress indication for API operations
- Summary report of locations assigned/skipped
- Option to preview changes before saving
- Choice of output file naming

## Summary

This foundation will support the immediate need while enabling seamless integration of the planned advanced features.
